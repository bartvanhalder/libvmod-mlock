vmod-mlock
============


SYNOPSIS
========

import mlock;

sub vcl_init {
  mlock.all()
}

DESCRIPTION
===========

Mlock Varnish vmod to use the mlockall() syscall to prevent
varnish from being swapped out.

INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building.

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For instance, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

::

 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export ACLOCAL_PATH=${PREFIX}/share/aclocal

The module will inherit its prefix from Varnish, unless you specify a
different ``--prefix`` when running the ``configure`` script for this
module.

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.

If you build a dist tarball, you don't need any of the autotools or
pkg-config. You can build the module simply by running::

 ./configure
 make

Installation directories
------------------------

By default, the vmod ``configure`` script installs the built vmod in the
directory relevant to the prefix. The vmod installation directory can be
overridden by passing the ``vmoddir`` variable to ``make install``.

USAGE
=====

In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines::

        import mlock;

        sub vcl_init {
                # This sets resp.http.hello to "Hello, World"
                mlock.all();
        }
